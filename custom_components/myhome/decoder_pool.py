"""Decoder pool manager for the MyHOME Dynamic Proxy.

Manages a pool of streaming decoders (squeezelite / Cambridge Audio) that are
physically connected to the BTicino F441M matrix source inputs.  The proxy
intercepts Music Assistant / Spotify play_media commands, claims an idle decoder
from this pool, routes the BTicino matrix to the correct source input, and
forwards the stream URL to the backend decoder.

Architecture
------------
- One ``DecoderPool`` instance per gateway, keyed by MAC address in
  ``hass.data[DOMAIN][mac]["decoder_pool"]``.
- Survives entity reloads (lives in hass.data, not inside an entity).
- Thread-safe: all claim/release operations are serialised with a single
  ``asyncio.Lock`` to prevent race conditions when multiple zones compete for
  the last available decoder.
- State-aware: inspects the live HA entity state of each decoder to determine
  whether it is truly idle before claiming.

Gain staging (anti-hiss)
------------------------
Each decoder carries an optional ``pre_gain`` offset (0–50 %).  When the user
adjusts the BTicino zone volume the proxy also sets the decoder volume to
``zone_volume + pre_gain``, capped at 1.0.  This keeps the analog signal level
high and the BTicino amplifier gain low, which reduces the inherent noise floor
of the 2-wire bus.

Typical values
--------------
- Cambridge Audio with Pre-Amp OFF: ``pre_gain = 0`` (already at full line level)
- Squeezelite / piCorePlayer:       ``pre_gain = 20``
